Upon review, Surveillance observed the incident in question at 0043hrs when the guest appears to wager 2x the Ante on his play bet for $50 ($25 Ante) on the river. The guest won that round. Surveillance, initiated a review of his entire play session when he first arrived on the table at 2338hrs and observed all procedures to be followed with no other instances to note. Live coverage was maintained on the guest until he left the Table at 0130hrs. At no other point was the guest observed not following procedures or attempting to cheat. As a result of it being an isolated occurrence and it did not appear that he was attempting to conceal (he was observed placing his wagers the same way before and after the incident) Surveillance deemed it as an Irregularity. It did not appear that his betting over the limit was intentional, CSM Poole was advised. Footage of the incident dubbed to TG2026-15.
